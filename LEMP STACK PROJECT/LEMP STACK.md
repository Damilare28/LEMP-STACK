# What is LEMP Stack?
The LEMP stack is a collection of software used to serve dynamic websites and web applications. It is an acronym that stands for:
  1. Linux: The operating system (usually a Linux-based distribution like Ubuntu or CentOS) that forms the foundation of the stack.
  2. Engine-X (Nginx): The web server software that serves the web content. It acts as a reverse proxy server, handling HTTP requests.
  3. MySQL (or MariaDB): The relational database management system that stores website data.
  4. PHP (or Python/Perl): The programming language that processes dynamic content and communicates with the database.
